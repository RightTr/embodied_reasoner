## Overview 🦾🦾
In this paper, we present **Embodied-Reasoner**, a multimodal embodied model that extends o1-style deep-reasoning capabilities to embodied interactive tasks. It can perform complex tasks in AI2THOR such as searching for hidden objects, manipulating and transporting items with several impressive features:
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 0.33;">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>👉 Deep Reasoning</strong> abilities, e.g., <strong>analysis</strong>, <strong>spatial reasoning</strong>, <strong>reflection</strong>, <strong>planning</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>👉 Interleaved Multimodal Processing</strong> capabilities, especially handling long sequences of interleaved image-text context</li>
      <li><strong>👉 Environmental Interaction</strong> abilities, enabling it to autonomously observe the environment, explore rooms, and find hidden objects</li>
      <li><strong>👉 Open-source Models</strong> released in 7B/2B sizes</li>
      <li><strong>👉 Open-source Dataset</strong> 🤗 <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/zwq2018/embodied_reasoner">Hugging Face</a>: 9.3k interleaved observation-reasoning-action trajectories, including 64K images and 8M thought tokens.</li>

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:   

> **Task and Trajectory Engine:** Automatically synthesizes coherent **Observation-Thought-Action** trajectories, spaning 107 diverse indoor scenes, e.g., kitchens and living rooms, and covers 2,100 interactive objects (e.g., eggs, laptops) and 2,600 containers (e.g., refrigerators, drawers), *64K* a first-person perspective image from interaction and *8M* thought tokens.

<p>  

> **Long CoT with Diverse Thinking Pattern:** analysis, spatial reasoning, reflection, planning, and verification. These coherent, image-text interleaved trajectories boost its spatial, temporal reasoning capabilities.
<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/state_trans.jpg" height="350" style="display:inline-block;"/>
<p>  

> **Iterative Training Pipeline:** A three-stage iterative training pipeline that combines **imitation learning**, **self-exploration tunning**, and **self-correction tunning**.   


> **Interactive Evaluation Framework:** 809 test cases across 12 novel scenarios: `<Instruction, Key Action, Final state >`

## Performance 🌿🌿
We compare the performance of Embodied-Reasoner against advanced VLMs and visual reasoning models. 
- Success Rate (%) measures whether a task is successfully completed. 
- Search Efficiency (%) evaluates task efficiency—more steps indicate lower efficiency. 
- Task Completeness (%) computes the proportion of predicted actions that belong to the set of key actions.

## Examples 👀 👀
### Simulator Experiments
Embodied-Reasoner exhibits spontaneous thinking behaviors, e.g., analyzing environmental states (#1,3), reflecting on missed details (#4), reasoning based on the latest observations (#5), and recalling cues for efficient planning (#9). These thoughts remain coherent and logically consistent despite spanning multiple rounds. In contrast, general VLMs lacking thinking abilities struggle with long-horizon interactive tasks and produce unreasonable actions, e.g., forget tasks or repetitive searching.

### Real-World Experiments
To evaluate the generalization of our reasoning model, we design a real-world experiment. Our model rules out the countertop and dining table after two explorations (steps 1,2), ultimately locating the coffee (#7) in the cabinet and placing it in the microwave for heating (#11). However, we observe that OpenAI o3-mini fails to formulate a reasonable plan, heading to the microwave first instead of searching for the coffee.

## Task and Trajectory Engine ⛲⛲

You can navigate to the data_engine folder to synthesize tasks and trajectories. Below are the key files within the data_engine:

```plaintext
data_engine/
├── taskgenerate/               # Item information and room metadata for task generation
│   ├── bathrooms/
│   ├── bedrooms/
│   ├── kitchens/
│   ├── living_rooms/
│   └── pick_up_and_put.json
├── TaskGenerate.py             # Task synthesis script
├── o1StyleGenerate.py          # Trajectory synthesis script
├── o1StyleGenerate_ordered.py  # Complex task trajectory synthesis script
├── vlmCall.py                  # Script to call the VLM
└── vlmCallapi_keys.py          # Please Set your API keys here

```


#### Step 1. Generate Task
`TaskGenerate.py` can synthesize task templates and corresponding key actions. The generated task-related data will be stored in the `<tasktype>_metadata` folder under data_engine.

You can run the following Python script to perform the task generation, and can modify parameters like task types within this Python file.
```shell
python TaskGenerate.py
```

For example, one generated task data entry is shown below, where actions contains a list of key actions for the task.
```json
{
    "taskname": "Locate the Apple in the room.",
    "tasktype": "single_search",
    "metadatapath": "taskgenerate/kitchens/FloorPlan1/metadata.json",
    "actions": [
        {
            "action": "navigate to",
            "objectId": "CounterTop|-00.08|+01.15|00.00",
            "objectType": "CounterTop",
            "baseaction": "",
            "reward": 1,
            "relatedObject": [
                "CounterTop|-00.08|+01.15|00.00",
                "Apple|-00.47|+01.15|+00.48"
            ]
        },
        {
            "action": "end",
            "objectId": "",
            "objectType": "",
            "baseaction": "",
            "reward": 1,
            "relatedObject": [
                "CounterTop|-00.08|+01.15|00.00",
                "Apple|-00.47|+01.15|+00.48"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "totalreward": 2
}
```

#### Step 2. Generate O1-style Trajectory
`o1StyleGenerate.py` and `o1StyleGenerate_ordered.py` can synthesize trajectories for 10 different sub-task types. Specifically, o1StyleGenerate_ordered.py is designed to synthesize more complex sequential object transfer tasks.

You can run the following Python script to perform the trajectory generation. Additionally, you can set the task type and trajectory type within the script (typically, 'b' is shortest, 'a' is longer, and 'c' is the longest).

```shell
python o1StyleGenerate.py
python o1StyleGenerate_ordered.py
```

Below is an example folder of a generated trajectory, including the JSON file and associated images for the trajectory.
<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/trajectory.png"/ height=180>
<p>


Below is an example of the JSON file contents:

```json
{
    "scene": "FloorPlan1",
    "tasktype": "...",
    "taskname": "Locate the Apple in the room.",
    "trajectory": [
        "<...>...</...>",
        "<...>...</...>",
        "..."
    ],
    "images": [
        ".../init_observe.png",
        "..."
    ],
    "flag": "",
    "time": "...",
    "task_metadata": {
        "..."
    }
}
```
- **scene:** the scene where the task is performed.
- **tasktype:** the type of the task.
- **taskname:** the name of the task.
- **trajectory:** reasoning and decision-making content of the trajectory
- **images:** paths to corresponding images (the first image represents the initial state; each subsequent image corresponds to the state after performing each action listed in trajectory).
- **time and flag:** records the generation timestamp and exceptions encountered during trajectory generation.
- **task_metadata:** task information generated during Step 1.
